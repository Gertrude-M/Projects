# Global Cancer Patients Analysis(2015-2024)
## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores and visualizes trends in cancer cases globally using the `global_cancer_patients_2015_2024.csv` dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on patient demographics, cancer types, disease stages, treatment costs, and regional distribution over a 10-year period.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `tidyverse` for data manipulation  
  - `dplyr` for summarizing and transforming data  
  - `ggplot2` for data visualization

### 📊 Key Analyses Performed

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
     * Computed average and standard deviation of patient ages.
2. **Cancer Type Distribution**
     * Counted and visualized the frequency of different cancer types using a bar chart.
3. **Patient Age Distribution**
     * Created a histogram to show the spread of patient ages across the dataset.  
4. **Gender Distribution**
     * Visualized the count of male vs. female patients with cancer.
5. **Cancer Stage vs Survival Years**
     * Used a boxplot to assess the relationship between cancer stage and survival duration.
6. **Regional Cancer Burden**
     * Mapped the number of cancer cases per region using a ranked bar chart. 
8. **Treatment Cost Analysis**
     * Visualized treatment cost variation across cancer types using boxplots.
9. **Obesity Levels Distribution**
     * Analyzed the distribution of obesity levels across cancer patients using a histogram.

### 📌 Sample Insight

- Colon and prostate cancers appeared among the most prevalent globally.  
- Higher cancer stages were associated with shorter survival durations.  
- Certain cancer types exhibited significantly higher treatment costs.  
- Male gender appeared to be the one most affected globally.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Build predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict survival outcomes.
- Perform multivariate analysis on factors affecting treatment costs.
- Perform time series forecasting of cancer trends post-2024.
